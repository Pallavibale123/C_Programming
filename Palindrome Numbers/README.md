Function isPalindrome

Purpose: Checks if the integer x is a palindrome.
Parameters: int x - The integer to be checked.
Return Type: bool - Returns true if x is a palindrome, otherwise returns false.
Handling Negative Numbers

if (x < 0) return false;: Checks if x is negative. Negative numbers are not palindromes by definition, so the function immediately returns false if x is negative.
Variables

int original = x;: Stores the original value of x for later comparison.
long reversed = 0;: Initializes reversed to 0. long is used to accommodate potentially large numbers resulting from the reversal process without overflow.
Reversing the Number

while (x != 0) { ... }: Uses a while loop to reverse the digits of x.
Inside the loop:
int digit = x % 10;: Calculates digit as the last digit of x using modulus operation (x % 10).
reversed = reversed * 10 + digit;: Builds the reversed number by shifting reversed left (reversed * 10) and adding digit.
x /= 10;: Updates x by removing its last digit (x /= 10).
Checking for Palindrome

After the loop, the function checks if original (the original input) is equal to reversed (the reversed number).
return original == reversed;: Returns true if they are equal, indicating x is a palindrome. Returns false otherwise.
Main Function (main()):

Purpose: Takes user input, calls isPalindrome() to check if the input is a palindrome, and displays the result.
Process:
Prompts the user to enter an integer (printf("Enter an integer: ")).
Reads the integer entered by the user (scanf("%d", &x);).
Calls isPalindrome(x) to determine if x is a palindrome.
Prints the appropriate message based on the result (printf("%d is a palindrome.\n", x); or printf("%d is not a palindrome.\n", x);).
